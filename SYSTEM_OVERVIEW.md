# High Risk Pattern Detection System - System Overview

## Introduction

The High Risk Pattern Detection System is a comprehensive tool designed by Jeff Jackson to analyze claims data and identify potential fraud patterns, high-risk behaviors, and unusual claim activities. This system helps insurance companies and warranty providers identify suspicious patterns that may require further investigation.

## System Components

1. **Core Detection Engine (`risk_detector.py`)**
   - Contains the `RiskDetector` class with all risk detection algorithms
   - Handles data loading, preprocessing, and analysis
   - Implements seven distinct risk detection algorithms
   - Generates CSV outputs and summary reports

2. **Visualization and Reporting (`detect_high_risk.py`)**
   - Creates visualizations for detected risk patterns
   - Generates an HTML report with interactive elements
   - Provides comprehensive analysis of all risk patterns
   - Includes charts and graphs for visual analysis

3. **Command-Line Interface (`run_risk_detection.py`)**
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for running the system
   - Allows customization of detection thresholds
   - Supports various output options
   - Includes help documentation and examples

4. **Testing Module (`test_risk_detector.py`)**
   - Verifies the functionality of all risk detection algorithms
   - Tests data loading and processing capabilities
   - Validates output formats and accuracy
   - Ensures system reliability

## Risk Detection Algorithms

The system implements seven distinct risk detection algorithms:

1. **Multiple Claims per VIN Detection**
   - Identifies vehicles with multiple claims above a threshold
   - Flags potential fraud or problematic vehicles
   - Groups data by VIN and counts claims per VIN

2. **High Dollar Claim Detection**
   - Uses statistical methods to identify claims with unusually high payment amounts
   - Calculates thresholds based on mean and standard deviation
   - Flags outliers for further investigation

3. **Multiple Dealer Same VIN Detection**
   - Identifies VINs with claims from multiple selling dealers
   - Flags potential dealer fraud or data entry issues
   - Groups by VIN and counts unique selling dealers

4. **Repeated Claims Timeframe Analysis**
   - Detects VINs with multiple claims within a short timeframe
   - Identifies potential abuse of the claims system
   - Analyzes time between claims for suspicious patterns

5. **High Claims per Dealer Detection**
   - Identifies selling dealers with high claim frequency or amounts
   - Flags potential dealer-level issues
   - Analyzes claim counts and amounts per dealer

6. **Luxury Vehicle Pattern Detection**
   - Analyzes luxury vehicles for excessive claim amounts
   - Identifies premium vehicle abuse patterns
   - Compares claim amounts across vehicle brands

7. **Coverage Type Pattern Analysis**
   - Identifies patterns in specific coverage types with high claim rates
   - Highlights potential product design issues
   - Analyzes claim frequency and amounts by coverage type

## Output and Reporting

The system generates several types of outputs:

1. **CSV Files**
   - Detailed data for each risk pattern detected
   - Raw data for further analysis
   - Structured format for easy import into other systems

2. **Summary Report**
   - Text file with key statistics and findings
   - Overview of all detected risk patterns
   - Quantitative analysis of risk factors

3. **Visualizations**
   - Charts and graphs illustrating the detected patterns
   - Visual representation of key risk indicators
   - PNG format for easy sharing and inclusion in reports

4. **HTML Report**
   - Interactive web report with all findings and visualizations
   - Comprehensive analysis of all risk patterns
   - User-friendly interface for exploring results

## Usage

The system can be used in several ways:

1. **Basic Usage**
   ```bash
   python run_risk_detection.py
   ```

2. **Custom Input File**
   ```bash
   python run_risk_detection.py --file "your_claims_data.xlsx"
   ```

3. **Custom Output Directory**
   ```bash
   python run_risk_detection.py --output "results_folder"
   ```

4. **Custom Detection Thresholds**
   ```bash
   python run_risk_detection.py --vin-threshold 3 --dollar-threshold 2.5 --days-threshold 15
   ```

5. **Open Report in Browser**
   ```bash
   python run_risk_detection.py --open-report
   ```

## Customization

The system is highly customizable through command-line arguments:

- `--vin-threshold`: Minimum number of claims to flag a VIN
- `--dollar-threshold`: Standard deviation threshold for high dollar claims
- `--days-threshold`: Maximum days between claims to flag as repeated
- `--dealer-count-threshold`: Minimum number of claims to consider a dealer high-risk
- `--dealer-amount-multiplier`: Multiplier of average claim amount to flag a dealer

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the system include:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Implement ML algorithms for anomaly detection
   - Train models on historical fraud data
   - Develop predictive risk scoring

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Process claims data in real-time
   - Send alerts for high-risk patterns
   - Integrate with existing monitoring systems

3. **Advanced Visualization**
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Network analysis of relationships
   - Temporal pattern visualization

4. **API Integration**
   - Expose risk detection as an API service
   - Integrate with external systems
   - Support automated workflows

5. **Additional Risk Patterns**
   - Geographic concentration analysis
   - Seasonal pattern detection
   - Service provider relationship analysis
