# Instructions to Push Code to GitHub

Since we're working in a sandbox environment, you'll need to push the code from your local machine. Here are the steps:

## 1. Download the Repository Files

First, download all the files we've created. You can do this by:
- Using the download button in the sandbox interface to download individual files, or
- Creating a zip file of all files and downloading that

## 2. Set Up Local Repository

Once you have the files on your local machine:

1. Create a new directory for the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir high-risk-detector
   cd high-risk-detector
   ```

2. Copy all the downloaded files into this directory, maintaining the same folder structure.

3. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git branch -M main
   ```

4. Add all files to the repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. Commit the files:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git commit -m "Initial commit: High Risk Pattern Detection System"
   ```

## 3. Push to GitHub

1. Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/jeff99jackson99/high-risk-detector.git
   ```

2. Push the code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Enter your GitHub credentials when prompted.

## 4. Enable GitHub Pages

After pushing the code:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/jeff99jackson99/high-risk-detector
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select the "gh-pages" branch (this will be created automatically by the GitHub Actions workflow)
5. Click "Save"

Your web application will be deployed to: https://jeff99jackson99.github.io/high-risk-detector/

## 5. Verify Deployment

1. Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the deployment process
2. Once the workflow completes successfully, visit https://jeff99jackson99.github.io/high-risk-detector/ to see your deployed application

## Note on GitHub Authentication

If you're using HTTPS for GitHub (as shown in the commands above), you'll be prompted for your username and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password.

To create a personal access token:
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give it a name, select the "repo" scope
4. Click "Generate token"
5. Use this token as your password when pushing to GitHub
